You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.




select case
            when P is NULL then concat(N ," Root" )
            when N in (select distinct(P) from BST)   then concat (N, ' Inner')
            else concat(N," Leaf")
        end
from BST
order by N asc ;
