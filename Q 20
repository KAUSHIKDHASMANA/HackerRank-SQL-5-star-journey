Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.


given table with sides of triangle



select case
            when A+B>C and B+C>A and A+C>B  then
                case
                    when A=B and B=C and A=C then 'Equilateral'
                    when A=B or B=c or A=C then 'Isosceles'
                    else 'Scalene'
                end
            else 'Not A Triangle'
        end
